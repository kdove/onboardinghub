# onboardinghub
Onboarding-Hub is an onboarding automation app for organizing team members and their properties into visual web pages

# Employee Onboarding Automation

* One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. 

* The method in which code is organized and defined is just as important as the code itself. 


* This project is a Node CLI app that takes in information via user prompts using npm inquierer about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

 
 * this application passes all tests last time it was built


## Project Specifications

* 1.0. UI CLI.
  This app is a software engineering org chart generator command line application. 

* 1.1 UI Input Prompts.
  The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
  
* 1.2. UI Flexibility.
  The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 
  
* 1.3. This assignment    
  must also pass all unit tests. 
  
* 1.4 HTML File Creation
  When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted Orginization chart based on the information provided by the user. 
  
* 1.5 User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## SETTING UP YOUR ENVIORNMENT

* 2.0 Use the [Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) 

  * to prompt the user for each of the following properties from each user; 
    * email, 
    * id, 
    * and specific information based on their role with the company. 
    * For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

* This app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

* Below is an example of what the application may look like. Remember, the styling may change from time to time and is arbitrary, socompletely it will certainly be unique.

* In the `Develop` folder, there is a `package.json`, so make sure to `npm install`.

* The dependencies are, [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.

* There are also unit tests to help you build the classes necessary.

* This workflow is used in the build process:

1. Run tests
2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
3. Repeat

*Note to self: ðŸŽ— Remember, you can run the tests at any time with `npm run test`

* This project will *start with a directory structure as per the following spec:

```
lib/           // classes and helper code
output/        // rendered output
templates/     // HTML template(s)
test/          // jest tests
  Employee.test.js
  Engineer.test.js
  Intern.test.js
  Manager.test.js
app.js         // Runs the application
```

### Additional Infomration

* This project uses multiple HTML templates for each user type. For example, the following templates will be used to start:

  * `main.html`

  * `engineer.html`
  
  * `intern.html`
  
  * `manager.html`

* Methods will be programmed with logicical classes. Logical classes will build the logic for testing easier.

* All employees will share a base class of `Employee`, the properties for this class will be applied to all classes.

* In the HTML template files, A placeholder character/number is used to make sure the program identify where the dynamic markup begins and ends, I call this SMART programming.

## Minimum Requirements Will be Achieved Prior to project comletion

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.

* All tests must pass.

### Classes
The project includes these classes: `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`,`Intern`. 

The tests for these classes in the `tests` path all pass the testing scope.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and
methods:

  * name
  * id
  * email
  * getName()
  * getId()
  * getEmail()
  * getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have:

  * officeNumber

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have:

  * github  // GitHub username

  * getGithub()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have:

  * school 

  * getSchool()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'

### User Prompt CLI Application

This application is a CLI app. The app uses "npm inquirer" to prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

### Team Org Chart output

The project generates a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted orginization chart. Each member entered during user inoput displays the following properties in the html card (in no particular order):

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

## Project Future Release Goals

* Use validation to ensure that the information provided is in the proper expected format.

* move logic to an app using an express server to build out a restful api, change the user inputs from the cli an html page with form fields for users to complete.
